# Invoke-BSOD
An application designed to invoke an undocumented NTDLL function used to BSOD a windows computer.

## What code do I enter to invoke the BSOD?
I have included an html copy of a webpage I used when developing this application in the repository titled "NTSTATUS codes.html", it contains the codes that are accepted when invoking a BSOD. Inside the html file is a link to the original site if anyone is curious.
